Feature: Plagiarism plugin works with a Moodle Assignment
  In order to allow students to send assignment submissions to Turnitin
  As a user
  I need to create an assignment with the plugin enabled and the assignment to launch successfully.

  Background: Set up the users, course and assignment with plugin enabled
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | 1         |
    And I create a unique moodle user with username "student1"
    And I create a unique moodle user with username "student2"
    And I create a unique moodle user with username "instructor1"
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user        | course | role           |
      | student1    | C1     | student        |
      | student2    | C1     | student        |
      | instructor1 | C1     | editingteacher |
