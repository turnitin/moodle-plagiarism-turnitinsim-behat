Feature: Plagiarism plugin works with a Moodle Workshop
  In order to allow students to send workshop submissions to Turnitin
  As a user
  I need to create a workshop with the plugin enabled.

  Background: Set up the users, course and workshop with plugin enabled
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | 1         |
    And I create a unique moodle user with username "student1"
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user        | course | role    |
      | student1    | C1     | student |

    And I navigate to "Advanced features" in site administration
    And I set the field "Enable plagiarism plugins" to "1"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Plagiarism > Turnitin Similarity plagiarism plugin" in site administration
    And I configure Turnitin Similarity credentials
    And I set the following fields to these values:

    And I press "Save changes"
    # Check that features enabled are displayed.
    Then I should see "Turnitin Similarity features"
    And I should see "Repositories checked against"
    # Create Workshop.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Workshop" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Workshop name                 | Test workshop |
      | turnitinenabled               | 1             |
      | accessoptions[accessstudents] | 1             |
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I edit assessment form in workshop "Test workshop" as:"
      | id_description__idx_0_editor | Aspect1 |
      | id_description__idx_1_editor | Aspect2 |
      | id_description__idx_2_editor |         |
